# Solar-System V.1
First version of a site with short descriptions of the planets of the solar system and the Sun.
Since I was a little girl, I was always obsessed with the wonders of the universe and its mysteries, so building a page about one of my biggest passions was a great opportunity to practice my skills.


TO BE ADDED IN FUTURE VERSIONS:
- Titles for each section
- An image slider (carousel) for the picture in the main section
- More sections for moons, asteroids, and others
- Change the design of the card for the sun
- Add a dark/light mode
- Add a Spanish version
